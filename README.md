# Minecraft Adventure Park

May - July 2023

The project focused on the planning and development process, from requirements gathering and wireframing to site design and CSS/HTML implementation. It emphasized user experience by efficiently organizing information based on importance and providing specific details on each page.

## Features

- **Effective Communication**: The project emphasized identifying target audiences and tailoring information accordingly.
- **Importance-based Placement**: Information was organized based on its perceived importance.
- **Page-specific Information Segregation**
  - **Main Page**: Provides key information.
  - **Detailed Service Page**: Offers detailed information on attractions and services.
  - **Customer Support Page**: Includes ticket information, park maps, accessibility information, and FAQs.
- **Sitemap**: A sitemap with contact information was placed at the bottom of each page for easy navigation.

## Technical Focus

- This project is crafted using pure CSS and HTML without JavaScript, focusing on the theme park concept.
- During the design phase, the primary purposes of the site (online ticketing, attraction information, visual branding, advertising, customer support) were defined, and the target audience was identified.
- An analysis of five similar websites was conducted to identify common information and their pros and cons, which were then incorporated into the design.
- Decisions on page division and information placement were made, followed by wireframing.
- Wireframes were refined using MS PowerPoint and Figma, selecting appropriate fonts and colors to create a simple design system.

## Reflection

- This was my first extensive use of Figma, and I found it optimized for applying styles uniformly across components.
- ChatGPT was immensely helpful in developing virtual content.
- Although it was a four-person project, I handled the ideation, documentation, Figma design, and implementation due to circumstances.
- Communicating solely via Slack was challenging, especially with different time zones, making it hard to coordinate meetings.
- Despite some review from two team members, I primarily treated this as a solo project due to my high standards for the final product.
