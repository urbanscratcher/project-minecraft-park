# Minecraft Adventure Park

May - July 2023

A static website project for a fictional theme park, created as an assignment for a web development team. The focus of the project is on extracting requirements, wireframing, and designing the site from scratch using CSS and HTML, rather than on functionality implementation.

## Features

- **Communication Focus**: This project centered around targeting specific visitors and determining how to group and place information effectively to communicate with them.
- **Placement of Important Information**: Information is prioritized and prominently displayed at the top of the main page.
- **Page-specific Information Segregation**:
  - **Main Page**: Provides key information.
  - **Detailed Service Page**: Offers detailed information on attractions and services.
  - **Customer Support Page**: Includes ticket information, park maps, accessibility information, and FAQs.
- **Sitemap**: A sitemap and contact information are placed at the bottom of every page.

## Technical Focus

- This project is crafted using pure CSS and HTML without JavaScript, focusing on the theme park concept.
- During the design phase, the primary purposes of the site (online ticketing, attraction information, visual branding, advertising, customer support) were defined, and the target audience was identified.
- An analysis of five similar websites was conducted to identify common information and their pros and cons, which were then incorporated into the design.
- Decisions on page division and information placement were made, followed by wireframing.
- Wireframes were refined using MS PowerPoint and Figma, selecting appropriate fonts and colors to create a simple design system.

## Development Notes

- This was my first extensive use of Figma, and I found it optimized for applying styles uniformly across components.
- ChatGPT was immensely helpful in developing virtual content.
- Although it was a four-person project, I handled the ideation, documentation, Figma design, and implementation due to circumstances.
- Communicating solely via Slack was challenging, especially with different time zones, making it hard to coordinate meetings.
- Despite some review from two team members, I primarily treated this as a solo project due to my high standards for the final product.
