# Minecraft Theme Park Website
- A static 3-page website created for a web development assignment
- Focused more on the development process rather than implementation, from requirement extraction, wireframing, site design to CSS and HTML coding

## Libraries & Technologies
- Implementation: HTML, CSS
- Design: MS Powerpoint (wireframing), Figma
- Communication Tools: Slack

## Development Notes
- This assignment, themed around 'theme park', was written using pure CSS and HTML without JavaScript.
- During the planning phase, the primary purposes of the site (online ticketing, ride information, visual branding, advertising, customer support) were defined, and the main target audience was identified.
- Investigated five similar websites to analyze commonly included information and their pros and cons, which were reflected in the design.
- Based on this, decided how to divide the pages and what information to place, and created wireframes.
- As wireframes were materialized through Figma, suitable fonts, colors, etc., were selected to implement a simple design system.
  - This was the first time using Figma extensively, and it felt optimized for applying styles uniformly across components.
- ChatGPT was immensely helpful in developing fake content.

## Personal Contribution
Over 95%
- Although it was a project for four people, due to circumstances, I handled everything from ideas, documentation, Figma design, to implementation.
- This was mainly because coordinating through Slack alone was difficult, and it was hard to gather everyone due to different time zones.
- Two members actively participated and reviewed, but since I had high expectations for the outcome, I considered it a solo project (which was actually favorable).
